## Features:

It was important of us to use technology that the client (Safe Parking LA) would be able to use with ease. As a non-profit we wanted to ensure they had tools that made their work easier and that they had the ability to upkeep on their own with out calling in external help.

- The application form was created using Google Forms (instead of their original AirTable forms) to allow for conditional questioning which streamlines the user experience, but is a tool that they can use to update the form themselves
- AirTable was used as their backend database - something the organization already had in place
- Using AirTable, added resources they had collated, and added a feature that allows users to find resources in geographical areas around LA County. This way, Safe Parking LA can continue to update these resources with the tools they already have.
